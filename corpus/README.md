# kengaku-shokunin corpus

Domain memory for LLM/model research & evaluation. Per
`~/projects/shokunin/CORPUS.md`: `knowledge/` entries cite a source;
`lessons/` entries cite round + evidence; every entry falsifiable or
marked opinion.

## Coverage map

- **Benchmark selection**: covered (knowledge/benchmark-selection.md).
- **Search-shape mechanism evidence**: covered at iteration-2 depth (knowledge/godspeed-eval-findings.md).
- **Run harness / telemetry spec**: covered at alpha depth (knowledge/telemetry-run-design.md).
- **Model catalog access**: Bailian index + HF/OpenRouter APIs + local GGUF inventory (knowledge/local-model-index.md, knowledge/open-model-catalogs.md).
- **Eval theory**: covered at digest depth — autonomy/IID assumptions, diversity blindness, judge-vs-aggregator split (knowledge/eval-theory-notes.md).
- **Executed eval**: covered at battery depth — authored 4-task slice (r4) + full 33-task re-run under fixed endpoint (knowledge/bench-arena-round5-battery.md).

- **Wiki branch digest**: karpathy subtree + ai/foundations + ai/books fully swept (knowledge/eval-design-digest-2.md); remaining open surface = non-karpathy `ai/` topics beyond eval scope.
- **Cross-pipeline stability**: byte-identical solution set identified (16, 25, 28, 32, 33); flip-set classified at n=3 (`knowledge/bench-arena-round6-stability.md`) and **component-ablated at r7** — of 5 "scaffold-determined" tasks only 13 is genuinely scaffold-caused; tools-without-system → `finish=tool_calls` 14/15; temp not the lever (`knowledge/bench-arena-round7-scaffold-ablation.md`).

## Open gaps

- **n≥2 on flip-capable tasks**: CLOSED round 6 — 8 flip tasks + 3 controls at n=3; flips decompose to scaffold (5), noise (2), strategy-bound (1). See `knowledge/bench-arena-round6-stability.md`. **r7 refinement: component ablation reclassified the "scaffold 5" → 1 true scaffold (13), 3 noise (03/08/31), 1 weak pull (12)** — see `knowledge/bench-arena-round7-scaffold-ablation.md`.
- **Planning-horizon coverage**: bench-arena is single-step; the deployed-agent bottleneck (agent-engineering note) is unmeasured locally.
- **27 test-timeout**: CLOSED round 6 — hidden-contract thread-exception deadlock + semantically-broken sol, not slowness. See `knowledge/bench-arena-task27-timeout-anatomy.md`.
- **Scaffold-delta mechanism**: CLOSED round 7 — verbatim wire capture (temporary proxy provider) + component ablation. Causal inventory: system prompt (context mass) drives strategy choice; `tools`+`tool_choice:auto` without system = `finish=tool_calls` harness defect; temperature absent→0.8 not causal; `enable_thinking` no-op (template has no think branch). See `knowledge/bench-arena-round7-scaffold-ablation.md`.
- **v2-vs-today scaffold drift** (new, round 7): the captured skills catalog may differ from v2's (v2 ran 1mo ago); E1 replay reproduced v2 direction on 13 but not 03 (v2's lone 03-PASS was a lucky draw — see r7 knowledge). Exact replay fidelity vs 1-month-old scaffold is unverified — attribute v2-side drift before citing v2 sols.
