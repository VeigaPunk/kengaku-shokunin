# kengaku-shokunin — Province

**Domain:** LLM/model research & evaluation — scopes ~/Projects/webzites/repos/llm-wiki, route telemetry

**Owns:** the domain knowledge, playbooks, error patterns, and checklists above.
**Refuses:** anything outside this domain; report cross-domain evidence back to the orchestrator rather than absorbing it.

## Surfaces (all resolve on this host; re-verified round 9, 2026-09-28)

| Surface | Path / endpoint | What this lane does with it |
|---|---|---|
| Research notes (SSOT for eval craft) | `~/Projects/webzites/repos/llm-wiki` — `wiki/ai/agents-and-engineering/`, `wiki/karpathy/`, `wiki/ai/{foundations,alignment-and-training,books,scaling-and-forecasting}/`, `Home.md`, `raw/` | digest into `corpus/knowledge/eval-*` entries; the `~/wikillm/llm-wiki` path does **not** exist here (`test -e` → absent) |
| Local benchmark battery | `~/bench-arena/` — `tasks/`, `grade.sh`, `loop.sh`, `report-grok45.csv`, `report-qwenlocal*.csv`, `telemetry-qwenlocal-v2.csv` | authored runs, status-flip and truncation taxonomy |
| Served local model | `http://127.0.0.1:34113` — `/v1/models`, `/health`, `/v1/chat/completions` (Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct **UD-IQ2_XXS**, `owned_by=llamacpp`, `n_ctx=16384`) | every probe in `corpus/evidence/`; identity re-probed each round |
| Route telemetry | `~/Projects/bounties/ledger/telemetry.jsonl` | model×lane and reroute-chain **inference about model service** only |
| Client CLI telemetry | `~/.bailian/telemetry.jsonl`, `~/.bailian/wiki-sync-state.json` | quota-vs-auth failure split, poll-verb rule |
| Model catalogs | `~/.bailian/skills/bailian-docs-llm-wiki/models/{index.md,models.jsonl}`, `https://huggingface.co/api/models`, `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` | selection fields, open-weight twins |
| Own probe artifacts | `corpus/evidence/round8-horizon/`, `corpus/evidence/round9-replication/`, `corpus/evidence/round9-fleet/` | durable run bytes + analyses; nothing cited from `/tmp` alone |
| Public literature | arXiv / ACL Anthology / ICLR proceedings / vLLM docs / GitHub issues (URLs in `corpus/knowledge/eval-prior-art-calibration.md`) | novelty pricing of local findings |

## Refusals and reported-out scope (round 9, `corpus/evidence/round9-fleet/sibling-overlap.md`)

- **Not owned:** the model-serving plane (llama-server flags, slot/batch
  config) — no lane owns it; escalate to the integrator instead of remediating.
- **kagi:** Janitor consumer-side endpoint/credential config.
- **kumitate:** OMP route resolution, fallback policy, operational failure
  taxonomy.
- **kasegi:** bounty ledger mission-state / dispatcher semantics.
- **kotoba:** prompt- and skill-craft rules, render/trigger behaviour — this
  lane keeps the *measured* effect of prompt format on capability and hands the
  reusable craft implication out.
- **kake:** web properties; the shared word "probe" carries no scope.

Reported out this round (evidence sent, not absorbed): (1) kotoba — keep an
explicit output-contract system prompt whenever tool affordances are exposed,
else a benchmark records `finish=tool_calls` instead of capability
(`corpus/knowledge/bench-arena-round7-scaffold-ablation.md`); (2) kasegi +
kumitate — the ledger split recorded in the round-3 aggregator ruling stays
explicit; (3) kagi — any Janitor consumer-endpoint discrepancy, with the
unowned serving plane escalated.
